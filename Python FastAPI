# This is the summary of Python FastAPI
What is FastAPI?
- It is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs in Python.

1. Introduction to Python coroutines
- It is a regular function with the ability to pause its execution when encountering an operation that may take a while to complete.
- It allows you to write non-blocking code that can perform tasks concurrently.
- It helps you run the program asynchronously to improve its performance.

To create and pause a coroutine, you use the Python async and await keywords:
- The async keyword creates a coroutine.
- The await keyword pauses a coroutine.

2. Python middleware
A "middleware" is a function that works with every request before it is processed by any specific path operation. And also with every response before returning it.
It is commonly used to enhance, modify, or inspect data and actions passing through them.
